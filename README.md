This code was written as a chance for me to test and develop my pyhon coding skills when I was early to learning the language and wanted some additional practise. I was inspired by the Tom Scott video - 'FizzBuzz: One Simple Interview Question', https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPZ0pIK_wsc. I used some of the code he developed during the video to inspire my own, although while he used JavaScript, I used python, so I did translate the code used from one language to another.

The idea behind coding FizzBuzz is it's a simple test to identify people who are competent coders during the interview and hiring process, by having them code something that'll play the children's game of FizzBuzz. The game is played by counting up in turn, but every time there's a multiple of 3, you say "Fizz", and every time there's a multiple of 5, you say "Buzz", and when it's a multiple of both, you say "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.
So:\n
1\n
2\n
Fizz\n
4\n
Buzz\n
Fizz\n
7\n
8\n
Fizz\n
Buzz\n
11\n
Fizz\n
13\n
14\n
FizzBuzz\n
16\n
17\n
Fizz\n
19\n
Buzz\n

So the coding element would be to write a program that outputs FizzBuzz for the numbers 1 to 100. Ideally the code should be easy to adapt - say change the number 3 for a 7, or say 'Bang' for any multiple of 8, and these changes should be as easy to implement as possible, with minimal edits needed.
